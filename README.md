# Motorcycle Data
This repo is a web scraper designed to collect a dataset of motorcycle models. The scraper uses a recursive generator to generate combinations of motorcycles from a set of select bars. The field are "year", "make", "model", and (optional) "trim".

The project requires python3 and virtualenv. Virtualenv can be installed via:

`pip install virtualenv`

The project also uses selenium (installed into the python virtualenv), which can be obtained via:

`pip install selenium`

Alternatively, you can use  run.sh/run.bat to install selenium to the virtual python environment before running the main script.
